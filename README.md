<b> FX Trading Data Analysis </b>

Exploring my interest in Data Science, I have analysed my FX trades from 2015 and 2016 using python - pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. 

In Part 1, I have analysed for 2015, in Part 2 - for 2016, and in Part 3, I have done a year-on-year analysis for those 2 years.

The analysis can be viewed from my github page, but a better way is to view them using jupyter notebook viewer.

Below are links to the analysis in nbviewer.

[Part 3 - Year-on-Year Analysis for 2015 and 2016](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zayedshah/FX-Trading-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Part%203_2015_2016.ipynb)

I have also put up the Trades dataset here - Trades 2015.xlsx and Trades 2016.xlsx, in case anyone wants to play around with it.
