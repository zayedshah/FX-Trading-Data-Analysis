<b> FX Trading Data Analysis <b>

Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn - I have analysed my FX trades from 2015 and 2016. In Part 1, I have analysed for 2015, in Part 2 - for 2016, and in Part 3, I have done a year-on-year analysis for those 2 years.

The analysis can be viewed from my github page, but a better way is to view them using jupyter notebook viewer.

Below are links to the analysis in nbviewer.
